# Overview

This is a Mobile Application built using Android Compose. I have built it with the intention of creating an application that can help those who struggle with routines.
{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
This app consumes an API written in Go that allows users to create routines with images so that children can see what they're supposed to be doing. This was originally created for my son, and I quickly saw that I could also benefit.
{Provide a description of your app.  Describe how to use the app.}

I created this app to fulfill the requirements of displaying the routines. It is meant to display only what is necessary. I want this app to help children to have better time management.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
